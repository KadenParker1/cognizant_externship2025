This is a financial tracker project. When ran the file will enter an infinite loop and be presented with a menu. You can select 1 to add an expense, 2 to view all expenses, and 3 to view a summary of each category. Selecting 4 will exit you out of the loop and the dictionary will reset. This project uses variables, data types, control structures, loops, functions, string operations, lists, dictionaries, tuples, and exception handling.
